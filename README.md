# tree-sitter-cdl

[CDL (Common Data Language)](https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/nug/2.0-draft/cdl.html)
grammar for [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter).

CDL is used to represent data from [NetCDF](https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-c)
files in a text-based, human-readable format.


## Project Progress

> [!NOTE]  
> This project is in early stages and therefore subject to significant
> changes.

It follows the tree-sitter guidance for
[adding new parsers](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/creating-parsers/index.html)
and uses the CDL syntax
[outlined in the NetCDF User Guide](https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/nug/2.0-draft/cdl.html).

A rough outline is as follows:

- [ ] Run tree-sitter-init and generate base repository
- [ ] Start writing basic rules into the grammar file
- [ ] Implement syntax highlighting for TextMate and use
